# Strategy for Downloading a Directory as a ZIP File

## Objective
Enable users to download a full directory (multiple digital products/files) as a ZIP file in a cost-effective, scalable way.

---

## ðŸ§© Options

### 1. **Server-Side ZIP Creation (Backblaze B2)**
- **Flow**: Download individual files â†’ Zip them on the server â†’ Serve ZIP to client
- **Pros**:
  - Retain full flexibility (users can delete individual files)
  - ZIP creation is dynamic (updated every time)
- **Cons**:
  - **Expensive**: Requires bandwidth and storage I/O
  - High server resource usage (CPU, storage)
  - Extra cost for file operations and storage
  - Harder to scale without dedicated service

### 2. **Frontend ZIP Creation Before Upload**
- **Flow**: User zips multiple files â†’ Uploads one ZIP file
- **Pros**:
  - Saves bandwidth and server compute
  - Reduced cost (Backblaze only stores ZIP)
- **Cons**:
  - No way to preview or delete individual files
  - Previewing/downloading demo files becomes difficult
  - Entire ZIP must be reuploaded if one file needs change

### 3. **Static ZIP Upload with Metadata**
- **Flow**: User uploads ZIP + metadata separately
- **Pros**:
  - Can extract and preview metadata/files individually
  - Allows hybrid download and preview
- **Cons**:
  - Requires structured file format and logic to manage metadata

## ðŸ’¡ AWS S3 vs Backblaze B2

| Feature                  | AWS S3                  | Backblaze B2             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Cost                     | High                    | Low                       |
| Presigned URL Support    | Excellent               | Decent via S3-compatible API |
| On-the-fly Processing    | Native (Lambda, etc.)   | Manual setup required     |
| Ecosystem & Support      | Large community + Tools | Small community           |
| Ideal For                | Scalable, flexible needs| Budget-friendly storage   |

## Recommendation

- If **budget allows**, use **S3** for maximum flexibility and simplicity.
- If cost is a constraint:
  - For static bundles, prefer **frontend ZIP creation**
  - For dynamic ZIP downloads, consider temporary server setup (Celery worker or Lambda-like solution)
  - Optimize with cache/redis to avoid repeating ZIP creation

---

## Developer Notes

- Avoid zipping large directories in real time unless absolutely necessary
- Consider using async task queues (Celery + Redis) to offload ZIP creation
- Cache previously zipped folders for reusability

---

## Final Thought

While Backblaze B2 helps lower costs, S3â€™s maturity and ecosystem significantly reduce developer effort and increase flexibility. Choose based on your productâ€™s priority: **cost vs control vs performance**.
